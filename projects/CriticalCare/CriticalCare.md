Critical Care is a <b> 2D Beat 'em up Brawl </b> game inspired by Double Dragon and TMNT series from NES. You play as a patient trying to run away from a hospital as he don't wanna pay up. The game was developed by two people using Godot as the game engine and Aseprite for creating the <b>pixel-style</b> sprite assets.

I worked on this game as a programmer and environment artist. My job includes:
- Programming enemy and ally behaviors.
- Player Controller
- Environment assets (Tilesets, object-props, and weapons)
- Scoring system

### Features
- Classic Beat 'em up feelings you find in NES games.
- Recruit other patient to fight together with you.
- Defeat bosses. This includes a security guard and a mad nurse holding a giant needle.
- Find secret keys to open mysterious doors.
- Beat all 3 stages and watch the ending cutscene!
